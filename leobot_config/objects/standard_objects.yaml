# This .yaml file stores information about the standard_objects from the roboCup@Work league
# Version 2021; units meter, kg 

# Description: A string to identify the object in detail
# BoundingBox: the cuboid in which the object fits
# Mass: The mass of the object in kg
# GraspPoint: Shift the point at which the object is grasped by this vector (in it's local frame). If it is [0,0,0] the object is grasped in the middle of the bounding box. 
# GraspWidth: how far the gripper yaws are opened in the local y-Direction
